        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These beef skewers are bringing all the flavor! Thinly sliced strips of steak browned and caramelized to juicy, sweet perfection.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Beef:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 lbs. <strong>skirt steak</strong>, cut against the grain into very thin strips</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>soy sauce</strong></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>garlic paste</strong></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>ginger paste</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon <strong>coarse kosher salt</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon <strong>curry powder</strong></li>
            <li>freshly cracked <strong>black pepper</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Serving:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>fish sauce</strong>, <strong>lime juice</strong>, and <strong>cilantro</strong> for topping</li>
            <li><strong>rice</strong></li>
            <li><strong>broccoli</strong>, <strong>bagged salad</strong>, or a <strong>quick cucumber salad</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep(optional)</strong>: Soak your skewers - 15 minutes minimum for wood skewers.</li>
            <li><strong>Beef</strong>: Mix the beef strips with the other beef ingredients. If you have time to marinate, go for it. A 30-45 minute marinating session is delicious! But I promise that if all you have is 5-10 minutes, they’ll still be great.</li>
            <li><strong>Skewer</strong>: Thread the beef onto skewers – just scrunch it on there (see video). Place skewers on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Top with freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Broil</strong>: Arrange an oven rack 4-6 inches below the heating element. Preheat the broiler on high heat for a few minutes. Broil the beef for 6 minutes – we’re going for caramelization on that top surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Let the beef stand for a few minutes; brush the golden tops with the pan juices, and drizzle with a bit of lime juice and fish sauce. MAGIC WILL HAPPEN. Top with cilantro or chili crisp and serve with a cucumber salad (recipe in notes). Holy smokes! You can eat them plain, drizzled, or in a rice bowl. They are finger licking good. I have been known to eat them standing right over the stove.</li>
        </ol>
